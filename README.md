# WestElmApp

* This project was created using **Angular 8** and ***responsively designed to be compatible for mobile, tablet, and desktop.***
* A locally stored static JSON file was used (_stored in /assets/data/content.json_) in order to mock HTTP requests due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing restrictions and related security issues with provided API. 
* CSS frameworks such as **Zurb Foundation** and **Ngx-Bootstrap** were leveraged to build a responsive layout and to reduce overhead time spent on application styling.  

## Deployed Site: 
* [West Elm - Front End Coding Challenge](https://west-elm-coding-challenge.github.io)

* Then navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`, the app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Further Implementation:
* Incorporate Angular's ***BrowserAnimationModule*** for a _less choppy and seamless user experience._
* Write ***unit test cases*** to check for _code quality and to test for any unforeseen software bugs._
* Implement a ***product search bar*** to _easily search for merchandise based on _name, cost, or color._
* Create ***navigation menu*** to _sort merchandise based on categories such as price, color, discounts/specials, etc._
